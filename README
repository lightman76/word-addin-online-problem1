Project that demonstrates a bug I'm encountering building an office JS add-in.  
It works as expected on Word desktop client, but fails silently in Word online.

To run this project:

   * npm install
   * npm run start
   * npm run sideload (to launch the desktop word version)
   * To test the online version, sign into your office online account
      * Insert->Office Add-ins and click Upload My Add-in in the upper right 
        and choose the manifest.xml file in the project
      * In a separate tab navigate to https://localhost:3000/index.html?et=
        - this will fail to load due to the self signed cert - accept the cert
   * load the add-in, click the button to open the sidebar, and in the sidebar 
     click the big Run link.

It should insert a new page at the end of the document with the heading of 
"Works Cited", a content control (with the text "loading bibliography"), 
and finally a message after the content control saying "Bibliography 
managed by ACME add-on"
